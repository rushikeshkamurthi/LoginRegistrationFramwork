# LoginRegistrationFramwork
How Simple it is to create something from scratch in Java #springboot . Spring boot already comes with build in standalone, production grade level ready made framework. You just need have clear understanding of the client requirement's. That's it !. Then most of the Logic and code you can write it your own referring some internet resources. Within 3 days of learning I was able to create this amazing login and registration service that let user register and once done. It send email confirmation for verifying the user. This small system design include deciding user roles, #authentication  and #authorisation mechanism, allowing some set of link without authentication and some link can only be access only after authentication. Remember Authentication allow user to enter into to system where as authorisation check if you are allowed to use one particular resource or not. I have used #postgresql  to store user data, Used postman to test this complete #api. Will try to add more features in future leanings.
